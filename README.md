# MiniDictionary
Implement your own Dictionary (with many more features than the traditional one!) </br>
The main feature is obviously to search for a meaning of a particular word and their type</br>
noun/verb etc. In many of the dictionaries when we enter a wrong word it shows “no results</br>
found”, but you will implement a function that displays words similar to the entered word</br>
available in the dictionary if they are not found. This can be implemented in various ways</br>
but you shall use Prefix matching.</br>
Implementation:</br>
● A search history. It helps the user to memorize the words as sometimes it happens that</br>
you forgot the words you searched for before, but you want to search the meaning again</br>
because you forgot it;</br>
● A translator from English to French.</br>
Note that,</br></br>
● you will need to use the provided CSV with 5,588 English words, their type (noun,</br>
preposition, verb, etc.), meaning, and French translation;</br>
● you should create a simple menu in consol for each of the above-mentioned features i.e.</br>
for 1) search word 2) print history 3) translate the word (the way you made it in TP1)</br>
Hints:</br>
● Prefix search:</br>
○ If a word is not present in the dictionary then look for the maximum length</br>
substring from the start which is present in the dictionary, and return all the</br>
words starting with that prefix from the dictionary</br>
Example:</br>
○ The dictionary has 7 words - "apple, apply, above, zebra, apartment, able, app".</br>
The search for the word "aplpe" should return "apple, apply, apartment, app";</br>
because these 4 words have the longest substring "ap" present from the query</br>
word</br>
● Explore TRIE data structure to implement all of the above-mentioned features</br>
(coursebook reference section 13.3)</br>
Test file:</br>
● You have been provided with the testPrefix.txt and testPrefixResult.txt file for checking</br>
the implementation on your own. Write a code which can read a file and generate the</br>
output text file as shown below.</br>
● testPrefix.txt contains a word in each new line to search in the dictionary</br>
● testPrefixResult.txt contains a total number of similar words for the respective searched</br>
word</br>
Example: For the test file given below</br>
testPrefix.txt</br>
App</br>
Againx</br>
Fom</br>
The output file generated by your code should be as follows:</br>
testPrefixResult.txt</br>
2697</br>
7 4</br>
